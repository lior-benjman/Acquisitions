        <h1>Hey, I'm Lior Benjman — IT & DevOps Engineer.</h1>
        <p>
          I build things that help teams move faster without breaking stuff —
          from automated pipelines to self-healing infrastructure. I’m big on
          clean deployments, clear logs, and calm nights. This blog is where I
          share what works (and sometimes what doesn’t) from my experiments in
          DevOps, automation, and cloud reliability.

            <h3>Why DevOps?</h3>
            <p>
              Why DevOps? I started in IT, fixing things that broke — usually on
              Thursdays. At some point, I realized I’d rather automate the chaos
              than chase it. That’s where DevOps hooked me. Now I build
              pipelines, spin up containers, and write scripts that make systems
              (and people) behave. For me, DevOps is just turning “it works on
              my machine” into “it works everywhere — even on Thursdays.”
            </p>
            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
            <p>
              I’m Lior, 25 years old, living in Tel Aviv. I love my two big dogs
              — Magnus the Rottweiler and Bonnie the Labrador —
              <strong>they keep morale high 24/7 (CI/CD of joy).</strong>
              During my military service I juggled three IT roles at once —
              <strong>so yeah, I don’t sit still.</strong> I’ve been working
              full time while studying Computer Science and holding a 91 GPA —
              <strong>because learning never stops.</strong>

            <h3>Current focus</h3>
            <p>
              • Automating everything that can be automated — CI/CD, monitoring,
              and the occasional coffee break.<br />
              • Building reliable cloud workflows with Docker, Kubernetes, and
              GitHub Actions.<br />
              • Turning messy scripts into clean pipelines that actually deploy
              (on purpose).<br />
              • Helping teams ship faster, crash less, and sleep better.

            <h3>A DevOps playground from day one</h3>
            <p>
              This blog started as a hands-on DevOps build. The entire backend
              is containerized, wired to a managed Postgres instance, and ships
              through automated pipelines. Every change runs linting and tests
              in CI before heading to production, then lands in a Docker image
              that’s deployed to my hosting provider.
            </p>
            <p>
              The static experience you’re reading is served by the same Express
              app that powers the API, so the site stays lean while still taking
              advantage of the existing auth, logging, and monitoring stack.
              Drizzle migrations keep the database schema in sync, and Arcjet
              adds a security layer on top of rate limiting and bot detection.

              • Docker-first architecture with dedicated dev/prod compose
              files.<br />
              • Drizzle ORM migrations and Neon Postgres for cloud-native
              storage.<br />
              • CI/CD via GitHub Actions, deploying directly from the main
              branch.<br />
              • Cloudflare front door with automated TLS and caching.<br />
              • Structured logging and health checks for container
              orchestration.

            <h3>Multi-environment delivery</h3>
            <p>
              Development runs locally (or via dev containers) with hot reloads,
              while production is continuously deployed. The graphic below
              captures the dual-server deployment path: one track for local
              validation, and another for the production-release pipeline.

            <h3>GitHub Actions guard the releases</h3>
            <p>
              Every push to production kicks off an automated GitHub Actions
              workflow that lints, tests, builds the Docker image, and promotes
              it to the live environment. Deployments stay consistent,
              auditable, and fast without me touching the servers directly.
